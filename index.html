  <div id="arma-3-sturko">
    <h3>Sturk√∂</h3>

    <p>
      In 1981, a Soviet submarine was discovered in the morning just outside the Swedish naval base, it claimed it was a navigation error but things quickly escalated.
      The Russians sent a "rescue" party while the Swedish primeminister gave the order "Hold the border", instructing the military to shoot if any ships crossed the border.
      Luckily, after a few days the submarine was returned to Russia and the crises was over, but this was the Swedish "cuban crises".
